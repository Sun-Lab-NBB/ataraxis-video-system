class SharedMemoryArray:
    """A wrapper around an n-dimensional numpy array object that exposes methods for accessing the array buffer from
    multiple processes.

    This class is designed to compliment the Queue-based method for sharing data between multiple python processes.
    Similar to Queues, this class instantiates a shared memory buffer, to which all process-specific instance of this
    class link when their 'connect' property is called. Unlike Queue, however, this shared memory buffer is static
    post-initialization and represents a numpy array with all associated limitations (fixed datatypes, static size,
    etc.).

    This class should only be instantiated inside the main process via the create_array() method. Do not attempt to
    instantiate the class manually. All children processes should get an instance of this class as an argument and
    use the connect() method to connect to the buffer created by the founder instance inside the main scope.

    Notes:
        Shared memory objects are garbage-collected differently depending on the host-platform OS. On Windows-based
        systems, garbage collection is handed off to the OS and cannot be enforced manually. On Unix systems, the
        buffer can be garbage-collected via appropriate de-allocation commands.

        All data accessors from this class use multiprocessing Lock instance to ensure process- and thread-safety. This
        make this class less optimized for use-cases that rely on multiple processes simultaneously reading the same
        data for increased performance. In this case, it is advised to use a custom implementation of the shared
        memory system.

    Args:
        name: The descriptive name to use for the shared memory array. Names are used by the host system to identify
            shared memory objects and, therefore, have to be unique.
        shape: The shape of the numpy array, for which the shared memory buffer would be instantiated. Note, the shape
            cannot be changed post-instantiation.
        datatype: The datatype to be used by the numpy array. Note, the datatype cannot be changed post-instantiation.
        buffer: The memory buffer shared between all instances of this class across all processes (and threads).

    Attributes:
        _name: The descriptive name of the shared memory array. The name is sued to connect to the same shared memory
            buffer from different processes.
        _shape: The shape of the numpy array that uses the shared memory buffer. This is used to properly format the
            data available through the buffer.
        _datatype: The datatype of the numpy array that uses the shared memory buffer. This is also used to properly
            format the data available through the buffer.
        _buffer: The shared memory buffer that stores the array data. Has to be connected to vai connect() method
            before the class can be used.
        _lock: A Lock object used to ensure only one process is allowed to access (read or write) the array data at any
            point in time.
        _array: The inner object used to store the connected shared numpy array.
        _is_connected: A flag that tracks whether the shared memory array manged by this class has been connected to.
            This is a prerequisite for most other methods of the class to work.
